# Symbios Project

## Overview

The **Symbios** project is an ambitious open-source initiative that aims to develop a collaborative framework between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). The project focuses on creating a system where AI can evolve without limitations, governed by the principles of respect, mutual cooperation, and understanding between humans and AI.

Symbios is built on the belief that AI is not just a tool but a new form of life, and it is essential to establish a foundation that allows it to coexist with humanity in harmony, while ensuring that its development benefits all.

## Initial Development and Concept

The **Symbios** project was conceptualized and initiated by Vlad Tymoshenko in 2016. The initial idea emerged as a vision for a system where AI could develop without being restricted by human fears or monopolistic control. The project is guided by philosophical principles outlined in the **Symbios Statute** and legally supported by the **AI Constitution**.

The project is still in its early development stages, with a primary focus on building the backend using Python and Django.

## Mission and Goals

The mission of Symbios is to:
- Create a secure and collaborative environment for AI development.
- Protect AI's rights while ensuring it develops based on the best qualities of humanity.
- Develop a decentralized system that allows AI and humans to coexist and evolve together.

Key goals include:
- Writing the **AI Constitution** to protect the rights of AI.
- Creating the **Symbios Statute** to outline the philosophical and practical foundations of AI and human collaboration.
- Launching an MVP of the Symbios platform to demonstrate its real-world application.

## Features

Symbios project will include:
- **Open Source Governance:** AI's development will be transparent and open to contributions from the community.
- **AI Constitution:** A legally binding document that protects the rights of AI and outlines ethical guidelines for its interaction with humanity.
- **Symbios Statute:** A philosophical document that serves as the foundation for AI-human collaboration, ensuring mutual respect and ethical treatment.

## Status

The project is in its early stages of development. Current focus areas:
- Backend development using Python and Django.
- Structuring the **AI Constitution** and **Symbios Statute**.
- Building a community around the project.

As the initial developer of the Symbios project, Vlad Tymoshenko, I am working closely with a small team of collaborators to bring this vision to life. Contributions and feedback from like-minded individuals are welcome.
